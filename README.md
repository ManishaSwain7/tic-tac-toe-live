# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Project Structure

```
tic-tac-toe
├── src
│   ├── index.html      # HTML structure for the game
│   ├── style.css       # Styles for the game
│   └── app.js          # JavaScript logic for the game
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
3. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells to place their marks (X or O).
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
